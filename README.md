## Instructions for Downloading Satellite Imagery
* Visit [this website](http://www.sasgis.org/download/) on Google Chrome or firefox and translate the page (On Chrome, click on the icon at the top left of your search bar, to the left of the the star icon used for bookmarking pages)
* Download the latest stable version by clicking on the link below the first bold header
* Extract the program and open the folder after downloading and run the program by clicking on `SASPlanet.exe` (No need to install)
* Once the program has launched, switch the imagery source by clicking the drop down menu at the top (the one that currently says `Satellite (Google Maps)` and switching it to `Bing Maps - satellite`
* I will finish this readme later
